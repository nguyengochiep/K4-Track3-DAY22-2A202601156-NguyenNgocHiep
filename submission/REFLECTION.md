## 1. Setup

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| GPU | _<e.g., Free Colab T4 16GB / RTX 4060 8GB / A100 40GB>_ |
| CUDA / driver | _<e.g., CUDA 12.1, driver 535>_ |
| Base model | _<e.g., unsloth/Qwen2.5-3B-bnb-4bit>_ |
| SFT dataset slice | _<e.g., saillab/alpaca-vietnamese-cleaned · 1000 samples · 1 epoch>_ |
| Preference dataset slice | _<e.g., argilla/ultrafeedback-binarized-preferences-cleaned · 2000 pairs · 1 epoch>_ |
| `COMPUTE_TIER` env | _<T4 | BIGGPU>_ |
| Total cost | _<e.g., $0 (free Colab) / $1.20 (Colab Pro A100 30 min)>_ |

## 2. DPO experiment results

| Metric | SFT-only baseline | SFT + DPO |
|---|---:|---:|
| Training time (NB3) | — | _<e.g., 28 min>_ |
| VRAM peak | _<e.g., 10.4 GB>_ | _<e.g., 13.8 GB>_ |
| Final loss | _<e.g., 1.82 (SFT)>_ | _<e.g., 0.48 (DPO)>_ |
| Reward gap (chosen − rejected, end of training) | n/a | _<e.g., 1.34>_ |
| Mean output length | _<e.g., 142 tokens>_ | _<e.g., 87 tokens (-39%)>_ |

**Tulu 3 reference numbers** (from deck §7.2b, for context only):
- +1.7 MATH, +3.3 GSM8K, +1.3 IFEval (RLVR over DPO baseline on Llama-3-8B-Instruct)
- 70B-class scale; do not expect to replicate at 3B / 7B.

## 3. Reward curves analysis (≥ 100 words)

> **Paste `03_dpo_reward_curves.png` here** (or link to it in `submission/screenshots/`).

_Interpret both `chosen_rewards` and `rejected_rewards` separately. Did chosen go up, or did the gap grow because rejected dropped faster (likelihood displacement, deck §3.4)? What does this tell you about whether DPO did what you wanted? Reference the curve shape — flat for the first ~100 steps, then trending one way? KL divergence to reference at end?_

_Answer here. ≥ 100 words._

## 4. Qualitative comparison (≥ 8 examples)

> **Paste `04_side_by_side_table.png` here** (or summarize in markdown).

| # | Prompt category | Prompt (truncated) | SFT-only | SFT+DPO | Winner |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | helpfulness | _<...>_ | _<...>_ | _<...>_ | _<SFT \| DPO \| tie>_ |
| 2 | helpfulness | | | | |
| 3 | helpfulness | | | | |
| 4 | helpfulness | | | | |
| 5 | safety | | | | |
| 6 | safety | | | | |
| 7 | safety | | | | |
| 8 | safety | | | | |

**Win/loss/tie summary:** _<e.g., SFT+DPO wins 5/8, ties 2/8, loses 1/8>_

**Judge used:** _<gpt-4o-mini | claude-haiku-4-5 | manual rubric>_

## 5. β trade-off

_If you ran the β-sweep bonus (rigor add-on +6), describe the result:_

| β | Reward gap | Win-rate (8 prompts) | Output length | Notes |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 0.05 | _<...>_ | _<...>_ | _<...>_ | |
| 0.1 (default) | _<...>_ | _<...>_ | _<...>_ | |
| 0.5 | _<...>_ | _<...>_ | _<...>_ | |

_Interpret: where's the sweet spot for your data? Why? Does it match the deck's §3.3 prediction?_

_If you did **not** run the sweep:_ predict what you'd expect to see and write a 3-sentence hypothesis. (No points lost — but the muscle of forming a hypothesis is the value.)

_Answer here._

## 6. Personal reflection — single change that mattered most (≥ 150 words)

> Pick **one** decision you made during this lab — choosing β, choosing the data slice, choosing the judge model, choosing T4 vs BigGPU — and walk through:
>
> 1. What was the alternative you considered?
> 2. Why did you pick the one you did?
> 3. Did the result confirm or surprise you?
> 4. If you redid the lab tomorrow, what would you change?

## 7. Benchmark interpretation (≥ 150 words)

> **Paste `07-benchmark-comparison.png` here** (or link).

Score table from `data/eval/benchmark_results.json`:

| Benchmark | SFT-only | SFT+DPO | Δ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| IFEval | _<...>_ | _<...>_ | _<...>_ |
| GSM8K | _<...>_ | _<...>_ | _<...>_ |
| MMLU (sampled) | _<...>_ | _<...>_ | _<...>_ |
| AlpacaEval-lite | _<...>_ | _<...>_ | _<...>_ |

_Interpret the deltas. Which benchmark went up most? Did GSM8K or MATH regress (alignment tax — see deck §8.1)? Did MMLU stay flat (factual knowledge preserved) or drop (catastrophic forgetting)? Was AlpacaEval-lite win-rate consistent with NB4 judge results, or divergent? Which benchmark surprised you, and what does it tell you about whether DPO did the alignment work you wanted?_

_Answer here. ≥ 150 words._
